## **Code Style Guidelines**

1. **Kernel Modules (C)**:
   - Follow the Linux kernel coding style. Use `checkpatch.pl` to verify your changes:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --file kernel/my_module.c
     ```
   - Add a GPL v3 header to all new `.c` files.
   - Ensure proper documentation for functions and structures.

2. **User-Space Scripts (Python)**:
   - Use Python 3. Ensure compatibility by testing with `python3`.
   - Follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) coding standard:
     ```bash
     pip install flake8
     flake8 user/
     ```
   - Add docstrings for all functions and classes.

3. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use the following format for commit messages:
     ```
     Short summary of changes (50 characters or less)

     Detailed explanation of what was changed, why, and any relevant context.
     ```

## **Testing Your Changes**

1. **Kernel Modules**:
   - Build the modules to ensure they compile without errors:
     ```bash
     cd kernel
     make
     ```
   - Load and test each module:
     ```bash
     sudo insmod <module_name>.ko
     dmesg | tail
     ```

2. **User-Space Tools**:
   - Run the Python scripts and verify expected behavior:
     ```bash
     python3 user/detector.py scan-processes
     ```

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure that kernel modules and user-space tools interact correctly.
